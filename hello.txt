To push code from a local Git repository to an existing repository on GitHub, follow these steps:
Navigate to your local repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and use the cd command to navigate to the root directory of your local project.
Code

    cd /path/to/your/local/project
Initialize Git (if not already initialized): If your project is not yet a Git repository, initialize it. 
Code

    git init
Add and commit your changes: Stage the files you want to push and commit them with a descriptive message.
Code

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Add the remote repository (if not already added): If your local repository is not linked to the GitHub repository, add the remote origin. Replace USERNAME and REPOSITORY_NAME with your GitHub username and the name of your GitHub repository, respectively. 
Code

    git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
Push your code to GitHub: Push your committed changes to the designated branch (e.g., main or master) of your GitHub repository. The -u flag sets the upstream branch for future pushes.
Code

    git push -u origin main
Note: If you are pushing to a different branch, replace main with the correct branch name.
After executing these commands, your local code will be pushed to the specified branch of your existing GitHub repository. You can then verify the changes on the GitHub website.
